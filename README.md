# Hello, my name is Tanja

I am currently a Bachelor's student in **Medical Informatics** at the Eberhard-Karls University of TÃ¼bingen in my 5th semester.  
Currently, I am exploring **software development, data analysis**, and **applications in healthcare**, while working on personal projects to strengthen my skills.

## My Current Work 
Projects I am currently planning/working on:


## My Previous Work
**Team project:** [Medical Data Privacy Tool](https://github.com/pfeiferAI/MedicalDataPrivacyTool_repo)  
Developed as a team project during my studies our _Medical Data Privacy Tool_ is a python tool for anonymizing medical datasets (.csv & FHIR) using multidimensional Mondrian k-Anonymity.  
<details>
  <summary>Project Details</summary>

This tool implements k-Anonymity to reduce re-identification risk while preserving data utility. It supports .csv and FHIR (.xml & .json) formats. The algorithm uses the multidimensional Mondrian method to anonymize datasets via recursive attribute splitting and generalization/suppression.

It allows the user to choose the k-value (level of anonymity) and minimum diversity threshold. The GUI enables easy selection of quasi-identifiers to be anonymized.  

For more details, feel free to check out the full Team Project repository with its detailed README.
